# Attention-Management-System
This repository hosts a Python-based attention management system designed to simulate human attention fluctuations during tasks and meditation periods. It includes features for template selection, custom template creation, attention simulation, and visualization of attention trends over time. Users can clone the repository, run simulations, and contribute to its enhancement under the MIT License.

The project implements an attention management system that simulates the fluctuation of human attention based on specific tasks and meditation periods.

## Features

- **Template Selection**: Users can choose from various predefined templates to model attention simulation.
- **Attention Simulation**: The program simulates how attention varies over time based on tasks and meditation.
- **Simulation Graphs**: Generates graphs showing the attention trend over time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attention-management.git
   cd attention-management
   ```

2. Ensure Python is installed. This project requires Python 3.

3. Install the required dependencies:

   python main.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a template or create a custom template.

3. Input the required details such as task duration, attention demand, etc.

4. Provide additional details like initial attention, minimum attention threshold, etc.

5. View the generated graphs and attention trend analysis.
